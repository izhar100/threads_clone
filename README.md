# ThreadsClone

## About the Project

ThreadsClone is an impressive social media application developed individually in just 7 days. It leverages the power of the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, JWT for authentication, and Socket.IO for real-time chatting. This app empowers users to create accounts, securely log in, and participate in a dynamic social community. Users can create image-rich posts, engage in likes and comments, search, follow, and even engage in real-time messaging.
